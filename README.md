## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project was to create a visually appealing bike-trip analysis in order to include it in a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. The goals were to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

* Out of the total number of bike riders (2,344,224) in August, a total of 1,900,359 of them were subscribers who use this service regularly
* 443,865 riders were customers who can potentially be converted to subscribers

* Out of the total number of bike riders (2,344,224) in August, a total of 1,530,272 males and 588,431 females used the bikes.

* According to this line graph, the majority of bikes( more than 145K) were rented for the trips lasting approximately 5 minutes
* After peaking at 5 minutes, the length of rides continued to decline sharply and only 1,102 bikes were rented for trips lasting 59 minutes.

*  According to this line graph, the majority of bikes( more than 145K) were rented for the trips lasting approximately 5 minutes and were rented by males
*  The data for female riders follows the same curve just in significantly smaller numbers of riders. 
*  The bikes are consitently used for short trips by both genders

Trips by weekday per hour

* Weekday morning and night  hours between 7 AM- 8 AM and 5 PM-6 PM are the busiest and mirror the hours when people working close by could be using bike sharing services to get to and from work. 
* Thursdays 5 PM and 6PM looks the busiest.
* Weekends look to be the opposite of the weekdays where there is activity throughout the day from 10 AM to 7 PM.
* Saturdays are busier than Sundays.

* There is no significant difference from the patterns of use established in the previous heatmap
* When grouped by genders, the patterns of use still remain the same for males and females
* The busiest hours are morning and night hours during weekdays and approximately 10 AM till 7 PM on the weekends

* Male subscribers are the primary users of this service
* The busiest day for service is Thursday when over 259K of bikes are rented by male subscribers
* The busiest day for female subscribers is also Thursday; however female subscfribers are renting only 88K of bikes. 
* The second busiest day is Friday, when over 233K of bikes are rented by male subscribers

## Summary

After the analysis the following conclusions were made:
* it appears that most CitiBike Users in NYC for the month of August were  subscribed to this bike renting service vs. single-use customers
* Overall, there are more confirmed male customers than others
* The busiest day is Thursday. The slowest day is Wednesday. 
* The peak usage occured on weekdays around 7-8 pm and  and 5-6 pm. During the weekends, the busiest times were the opposite and were spread pretty evenly throughout the day time. Saturdays were busier than Sundays.Customers used the service mostly on the weekends while subscribers were most active during the week, which can lead to the conclusion that the bikes are used by work commuters during the week and by tourists on the weekends.  
*  The CitiBike is a very convenient transportation method for short distance travel in a busy city. The majority of bikes were rented for short trips lasting less than 30 minutes. 
*  Travel patterns are similar for confirmed male and female users of this service; however, there are significantly less female bike riders. The reasoning cannot be established within the scope of this project. 


## Opportunities for additional analysis
If we were to proceed with additional analysis, the following visualizations could be presented:
* Heat map that represented the bikes most frequently rented. This could be usefull to determine which bikes to prioritize for maintenance. 
* Additionally, we could explore which locations are favored by subscribers vs.customers and if these preferences are consistent between the weekdays. These could help the company optimize bike availability during the week.
